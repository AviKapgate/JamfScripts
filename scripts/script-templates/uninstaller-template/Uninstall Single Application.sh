#            Name:  Uninstall Single Application.sh
#     Description:  A template script to assist with the uninstallation of
#                   macOS products where the vendor has missing or incomplete
#                   removal solutions.
#                   Attempts vendor uninstall by running all provided
#                   uninstallation commands, quits all running target processes,
#                   unloads all associated launchd tasks, disables kernel
#                   extensions, then removes all associated files.

# UNINSTALLER BASH SCRIPTS:
# A list of file paths for vendor-provided uninstallation Bash scripts.
# Note that vendor uninstaller workflows may differ greatly. Some vendors may
# use their own command-line tools, custom flags, or other workflows to
# accomplish this task (that's why this script exists!), so make any necessary
# changes to the below commands if the uninstall workflows are not Bash
# executable files.
#
# This may not work as expected if you reference nonexistent scripts or
# binaries, or if the uninstaller resources are not executable via Bash.
#
# If the vendor did not provide an uninstaller workflow, comment these array
# values out.

# A list of application processes to target for quit and login item removal.
