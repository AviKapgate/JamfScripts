#            Name:  Uninstall Pulse Secure.sh

# VENDOR UNINSTALLERS
# For each vendor-provided uninstallation tool file path that exists on the system, run the run_vendor_uninstaller function calling that path to run it. Note that vendor uninstaller workflows may differ greatly from app to app. Some vendors may use their own command-line tools with custom flags or other workflows to accomplish this task (that's why this script exists!), so make any necessary changes to the below commands if the uninstallation workflow isn't simply calling executable files. Call the function again for each additional uninstaller. If the vendor did not provide an uninstaller workflow, comment out or remove this line.
run_vendor_uninstaller "/Library/Application Support/Juniper Networks/Junos Pulse/Uninstall.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.sh"
run_vendor_uninstaller "/Library/Application Support/Pulse Secure/Pulse/Uninstall.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.sh"


# PROCESSES
# For each process related to the target product, run the quit_process function calling that process name to quit it. Names should match what is displayed for the process in Activity Monitor (e.g. "Chess", not "Chess.app"). Call the function again for each additional process. If no processes need to be quit, comment out or remove this line.
quit_process "Junos Pulse"
quit_process "Pulse Secure"


# FILE PATHS
# For each file and/or folder related to the target product, run the delete_file function calling that file name. Leave off trailing slashes from directory paths. Call the function again for each additional file. If no files need to be deleted, comment out or remove this line.
delete_file "/Applications/Junos Pulse.app"
delete_file "/Applications/Pulse Secure.app"
